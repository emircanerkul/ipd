IPD stands for Interpupillary Distance. It is the distance between the center of your pupils when looking straight ahead 12. In virtual reality (VR), IPD is an essential measurement that your VR headset needs for optimal performance 1.

Most VR headsets offer some way to adjust the lenses of the headset to suit different IPD. The lenses can either be moved closer together or further apart, or a software adjustment can be made to simulate a shifting focal point 1. Itâ€™s best for the optimal focal point of the lens to align directly with your pupils. This ensures that you get the sharpest image possible for that headset 1.

Knowing your IPD is important in VR because it can help you avoid eye strain and ensure that you get the best experience possible 1. There are several ways to measure your IPD, including using an app, a mirror and ruler, or asking your optometrist 12.
